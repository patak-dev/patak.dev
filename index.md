<BlogCover src="/images/patak-banner.jpg" />

## Welcome!

I'm a [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) core team member, a [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Elk](https://elk.zone/) team member, and I collaborated in Vue ecosystem projects like [VueUse](https://github.com/vueuse/vueuse) (see [three part series about ignorableWatch and useRefHistory](https://patak.dev/vue/ignorable-watch.html)), [Vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and others.

My current focus is on helping maintain [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), as its ecosystem and community are exploding. You'll [see me](https://github.com/patak-dev) in Vite's PRs working with other collaborators to help them land their fixes and improvements, working out issues, and building up with other maintainers the Vite team.

Apart from coding, I'm interested in helping Open Source communities grow into healthy spaces for collaboration. You'll see me around in [Vite Land](https://chat.vitejs.dev/) helping others and fostering connections between the devs that are propelling the ecosystem forward, making plugins, integrations, and frameworks.
