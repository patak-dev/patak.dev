# Update

_October 20, 2025_

I'm taking some time, and I'll explore new paths later on, so I’ve left my position at Bolt. They are an incredible team, and I feel very lucky to have spent the past years working with them. I'm grateful to the whole team for empowering me (and so many others) to work on open source. Working on Vite has been a fantastic and wild ride. The Vite ecosystem has grown past webpack and continues to expand rapidly. Vite, Vitest, and other core projects are evolving faster than ever, driven by amazing maintainers.

When I started to contribute to Vite, and was welcomed by Evan You, Anthony Fu, and other inspiring folks, I couldn't have imagined what would happen next. The discussions with early adopters and plugin authors in Vite's new Discord server, the team's growth, the effervescent times of Vitest's inception, the 24hs ViteConf online marathons, the feedback cycles to slowly cook Environment API, so much have happened. The Vite ecosystem has been a community of communities, building their shared infrastructure together. A ton of teamwork. Uncountable contributions from every direction. So many devs helping each other. So many maintainers crossing the borders of their projects to improve other's tools.

Eric Simons took a big bet on Vite when the web ecosystem was just starting to wake up to it. Bolt began sponsoring the project and then hired me to work on it full-time. I can't thank them enough. It was such an opportunity, shared with a few team members that also got supported by others. I had many hats during the past years; you can read a retrospective of the first years [here](./open-source-at-stackblitz.md). Later Ari Perkkiö joined Bolt too, and has been doing great work improving Vitest. I worked alongside extraordinary maintainers in Vite and other projects. We always tried to help others grow and take ownership. The idea was to create together spaces and connections that would outlast our efforts.

Vite is everywhere now. This vast scale prompted Evan You to create [VoidZero](https://voidzero.dev/) to reinvent Vite from the ground up. Their work on Rolldown and Oxc will soon revamp Vite and raise the dev experience of the whole ecosystem. VoidZero folks are incredibly talented, and together with other brilliant maintainers, they are making a ton of progress, fast.

Don't miss [the Vite documentary](https://youtu.be/bmWQqAKLgT4) for the story of the first 5 years. I want to thank all team members, contributors, and other maintainers and communities in the ecosystem for the wonderful journey. As usual for Vite, it feels like this is just the start. Unfortunately I couldn't make it there, but the first in-person ViteConf in Amsterdam showed that things are ready for Vite's next stage. There is so much more, but apart from the performance side, thanks to the rolldown-vite efforts, the composability through Environment API adoption should raise the shared layer bar once again and fuel even more collaboration. I can't wait to see how the ecosystem evolves from here.

I also saw another crazy growth story with [bolt.new](https://bolt.new), unveiled just a year ago. From the first prompts giving life to instant Vite apps, to holding the world's largest hackathon. Bolt is helping a ton of people to create Vite-powered apps these days. I'm forever amazed by the Bolt team's ingenuity. I know they will keep surprising everyone, as they have always been doing since releasing WebContainers.

It has been amazing crossing paths with the incredible folks building our shared commons. I learned a ton and truly enjoyed building together. I can't recommend enough that you get involved in Open Source. Join the communities and explore the repos. You'll find so many great folks along the way.

I hope to meet you there on new shared adventures in the future. See you around!
